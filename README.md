# PointNet Tensorflow 2.6.0
## The original repository for this code can be found at https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet. 
Since there is no recent TensorFlow version available in the original repository, I have created a TensorFlow 2.6 version of the code.
The environment setup for the code is provided in the environment.py file, and the code is written in Python version 3.9.
